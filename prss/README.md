## Quick note

prss is a hypothetical python3 compiler, which i'm working on in my spare time. 

Currently, i'm following instructions presented in the <a href="https://github.com/langjam/langjam/blob/main/resources/Python_compiler.pdf">book</a>.

Hopefully, my laziness won't cause any issues regarding the future life of this project.
